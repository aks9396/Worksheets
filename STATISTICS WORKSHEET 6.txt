10) Bayes theorem : It describes the probability of an event when we already know the previos outcome of  that may 		    be related to the event.

11) Z-SCORE : Its describes the distance of a variable from mean of data in terms of standard deviation. 

12) T-TEST : It compares the mean of two samples which is used in hypothesis testing with null hypothesis that the 	     difference between the means is zero.
             It helps to find out whether two population are different from each other or not.

13) Percentile :  It is the value below which the percentage of data falls.

14) ANOVA : It stand for analysis of variance which is a test to check the statistical differnce between 2 or more             populations.
	    

15) Anova is just like T-TEST, but it can be used to check for moe then 2 population groups whereas in T-TEST, we 	    can only check for 2 groups.
	    It checks the impact of one or more factors by comparing the means of different samples.
