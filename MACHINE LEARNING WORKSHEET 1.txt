11) OUTLIERS:  These are the data points which are at abnormal distance from other values,
               which may have arises due to some kind of errors like measuring, experimental,
	       data entry, etc.

      IQR:  A data poiint is said to be an outlier if it is more than 1.5*IQR below the first
            quartile or above the third quartile.

12) Bagging:  Each model receives equal weight as they are built independently which aims to
	      decrease variance.
    Boosting: Each model is weighted according to their performance. New models depends on
	      previously built models. Its try to reduce bias.

13) The adjusted R2 is a modified version of R2 that has been adjusted for the number of 
	 predictors in the model. 

14)  Standardization:  The process of rescaling the attributes so that they have a mean
	               of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
     Normalization:  The proces of rescaling the attributes so that their values will
	             lie between 0 to 1.

15)  CROSS-VALIDATION: it is a technique for assessing the effectiveness of our ML model by
	                spliting the data into multiple folds and training the algorithm on them.

		It reduces overfitting.
		Increases training time.
