10)  Advantages:

          1   It gives variable importance which helps in determining the variable which impacts
              positively.
	  2   Decision tree models are often overfitted, random forest classifiers wouldn't
	      get overfitted.
	  3   It can be used as a regression as well as classification model.

11)   It basically helps to normalise the data within a particular range. Sometimes, it also
	 helps in speeding up the calculations in an algorithm.
	Normalization and Standardization are 2 methods of scaling.

12)  

13) Accuracy is not a good measure for imbalanced dataset as it may be very biased.

14) F_Score is a measure of a test's accuracy and is defined as the weighted harmonic mean of
	 the precision and recall of the test.

	F_Score = 2. (Precesion*Recall) / (Precesion + Recall)

15)  fit() is used to calculate parameters for transformation.
     transform() It Transform the model according to fitted model from fit().
     fit_transform() it performs both the above function in single code.
