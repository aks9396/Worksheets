11) The main diff between Ridge and Lasso is that it tends to make 
    coefficients to absolute zero whereas Ridge never sets the value
    of coefficient to absolute zero.

12) VIF - The variance inflation factor identifies correlation between 
          independent variables and the strength of that correlation.
	  Suitable value for VIF is under 10.

13)      It basically helps to normalise the data within a particular range so
	 that unnecessary weight is not given to independent variables just
	 because of their measured units.

14) ADJUSTED R SQUARE
    RESIDUAL STANDARD ERROR
    MEAN ABSOLUTE PERCENTAGE ERROR

15) Sensitivity / Recall = TP/(TP+FN)
			   1000/(1000+50)
		         = 0.9529

   Specificity = TN/(TN+FP)
		  1200/(1200+250)
		= 0.8276 

   Precesion = TP/(TP+FP)
		1000(1000+250)
	       = 0.80

   Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN)
	    = (1000+1200)/(1000+250+1200+50)
	    = 0.88
